## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I will optimise the usage of custom properties / variables and do the same project using mostly class modifiers.

### Useful resources

- [font clamp() generator](https://clamp-generator.netlify.app/) - used it to set the fonts and paddings to be responsive to screen width
